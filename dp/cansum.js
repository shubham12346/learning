// Write a function `canSum(targetSum, numbers)' that takes in a
// targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

// The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it
// is possible to generate the targetSum using numbers from the array.

// You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.

// You may assume that all input numbers are nonnegative.

// For example, given targetSum = 7 and numbers = [2, 3], the function should return true because 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.

// Given targetSum = 7 and numbers = [5, 3, 4, 7], the function should return true because 4 + 3 = 7.
