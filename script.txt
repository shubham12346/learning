Sure! Here's a concise and confident self-introduction script you can use when an HR team asks you to introduce yourself, especially tailored for your frontend developer background:

HR Interview Introduction Script (Frontend Developer)

"Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I have close to 2 years of experience as a Frontend Developer, primarily working with React and TypeScript.

In my most recent role, I’ve led the frontend development of a project where I built the UI from scratch based on Figma designs. I also implemented reusable components, dynamic forms using React Hook Form, role-based access control, and integrated libraries like ApexCharts and React Big Calendar.

Alongside development, I took up responsibilities like requirement analysis, client communication, and even worked as a Scrum Master, which helped me understand both the technical and business side of things.

I’m passionate about writing clean, scalable code and enjoy exploring new tools and technologies that improve performance and user experience.

Currently, I’m looking for a role where I can contribute to impactful projects, grow as a frontend engineer, and work with a team that values ownership and continuous learning."

Want me to help tailor this even more based on the specific company or role you’re interviewing for?

Got it! Here’s a solid, professional script for answering “Why won’t you change your current company?” — this could be useful if you’re in a situation like being counter-offered, or being asked why you’ve stayed in one place, or even justifying why you might not switch.

Script: Why You Won’t Change Company

"At this point, I believe in growing where I am. My current company has given me opportunities to take ownership, lead initiatives, and directly interact with clients — all of which have helped me grow not just technically but also professionally.

The team culture is supportive, I have clarity on my growth path, and I’m currently working on projects that challenge me and align with my long-term goals. So unless there's a significantly compelling opportunity that aligns better with my vision or learning curve, I don’t see a strong reason to switch just for the sake of it.

For me, stability and depth of experience matter, and I want to make sure I create impact before thinking about a change."

Let me know the exact context — like are you saying this to HR in your current company? Or to a new company that’s asking why you might not leave? I can tweak it accordingly.

Absolutely! Here's a confident and positive script for “Why did you change your company?” — this is a common HR question, and your answer should show that the decision was thoughtful and growth-driven.

Script: Why You Changed Company

"I changed my company because I was looking for better growth opportunities — both technically and professionally. While I learned a lot in my previous role, I felt I had reached a point where I needed new challenges to push myself further.

I wanted to work on more complex projects, take more ownership, and be in an environment that supports continuous learning and innovation. Making that move was a conscious decision to step out of my comfort zone and level up my skills.

I believe each transition should have a purpose, and for me, it was about aligning my work with my long-term goals."

Would you like a version tailored to a specific situation, like if you’re moving for a better role, higher pay, work culture, or a new tech stack?

Of course! Here's a polished and honest script for "Why do you want to change your current company?" — this version highlights your ambition and desire for growth, while staying respectful to your current employer.

Script: Why You Want to Change Company

"I'm really grateful for the opportunities I've had at my current company — I've learned a lot and grown significantly, especially in frontend development with React and TypeScript.

However, I’m now looking for a role that can offer more challenging projects, a faster-paced environment, and a chance to work with a highly skilled team where I can continue to push my limits. I also want to expand my exposure to modern tools, architectural patterns, and end-to-end product development.

Ultimately, I’m looking for a place where I can make a bigger impact, grow faster, and align more closely with my long-term career goals."

Want me to personalize it further based on the company you’re applying to or the specific reason (like salary, remote work, team culture, etc.)?
